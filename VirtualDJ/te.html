  1. Website Visitors<br>
  Like most website operators, FM440 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
  and
  servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
  time
  of each visitor request. FM440's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
  understand
  how FM440's visitors use its website. From time to time, FM440 may release non-personally-identifying information
  in
  the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br>
  <br>
  FM440 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
  logged in
  users and for users leaving comments on
  https://would098.blogspot.com/2023/02/radio-440-mirchi-fm-welcome-to-radio.html?m=1">https://would098.blogspot.com/2023/02/radio-440-mirchi-fm-welcome-to-radio.html?m=1
  blog posts. FM440 only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
  uses
  and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.<br>

  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that FM440 gathers depends on the nature of
  the
  interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at
  https://would098.blogspot.com/2023/02/radio-440-mirchi-fm-welcome-to-radio.html?m=1 to provide a username and
  email
